how the same experiences can be completely reframed  
  
I was in a place of insecurity about sex and getting girls, that I didn't have to work to get Natasha at all  
   
my mind started being grateful for some things and I started trying to find things to be grateful of  
  
one of the first things was Natasha  
  
I went through my drunk snap mems from break  
  
and  
  
holy shit 2019 was an incredible, incredible year. truly something else  
  
and my mind shouted that I've had an amazing college experience  
  
which is crazy, because I've been mad insecure about my college experience up till this point. Not that adventurous or party or girl filled  
  
yet reframing a single insecurity into gratitude reframed my entire college experience (though I must be wary and not solely attribute this to gratitude, but of reframing and the veiliness of insecurity in general, and how insecurity can hegemonize a mind into its own frame)
