make lists

I'm looking for pleasure in a situation where there isn't any!

if I want to feel...try...
 - grounded
	- meditation
		- reading buddhism/taoism maybe? intentionally?
	- exercise (winter runs, stretching)
 - relaxed
	- relaxing conversation
	- TV / movies
	- reading relaxedly (physical book is important!)
 - flow state
	- cooking (esp. w grandma)
	- guitar & youtube
	- engaging conversation
 - pleasure
	- intentional experiences
	- planning, intentional construction of the future
 - comfort
	- walking (carrying) comfort, reduction of pressure & need-to's (outrights)
 - wonder
	- fantasy



she thinks all that I'm dealing with is human


maybe write down the things ammai says
