i took this time after college to have space to work on me & my spirit & learn how to root & learn how to be and not be scared  
  
and it was fruitful and i found some kind of peace i didn't rly have before  
  
then insomnia for two months ???  
  
now i am somewhat sleeping again but the peace is gone gone and bleh and is it worth still staying and finding it again ??  
  
these are the thoughts
