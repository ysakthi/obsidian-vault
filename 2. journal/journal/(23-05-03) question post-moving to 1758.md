i know i *was* ready to let go of a solid framework and move to a more internal, freer, more singularly liberationed one centered around returning & resting \[on\]. but the week or two of packing & moving pushed me a little backwards with respect to distractedness, worry, and craving. the question is: does the breath-framework still work? or do i need to move back to the plural, solid, multi-tooled one for a bit?

concrete action item :: i will continue with the breath-framework and gauge in a week. assess based on my systems, discipline, etc. if it's not working out (or if it breaks down before then), then i know to move to the other sort of framework for a while.

affirmation :: i WILL be able to \[re-\]construct the other kind of framework if needed !!
