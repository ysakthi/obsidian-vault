nlp as at great places

language & compsci -- 3 areas
1. pure linguistics -- what is meaning
2. attachment of meaning to a word -- like human cognition -- what is it to say something
3. the NLP

2 breakthroughs that changed ML
	1. GPUs - parallel processing
	2. deep learning
this allowed for vectorspace embeddings
with these advances, word tokens' meanings are determined in relation to USAGE and RELATION (to others)


things that i should do
-----------------------

1. coursera
	- knowing the basics like looking at a txt and getting the embedding vector would be huge
2. cloud
	- microsoft or aws have courses -- get really smart about cloud
	- get filthy with cloud -- i need to be comfortable
	- this is the only thing that matters these days
3. just read !
	- get some breadth
	- figure out what matters to me and get some depth
4. get all the contacts on linkedin, get my profile & presence out
	- note to self: linkedin premium has one month free trial
5. just some life advice -- use my network, build my own, then pass it on in the future ! 
	- maybe help something
	- john bullock at northwestern
