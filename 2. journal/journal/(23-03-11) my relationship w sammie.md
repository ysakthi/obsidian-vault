i should both forgive myself and repent. creating likenesses of her body without permission -- for my own desires -- is bad. it exposes her in a way that could deeply hurt her.

what's wrong with it? i am participating in fulfilling my desirous attitude towards women without questioning it even for a second. i want what she has to "offer," and i will go to great lengths to get it. i am allowing myself to succumb deeply to intense desires.

the attitude is so harmful; it is the attitude of 'i will do whatever i can to have this person fulfill my desires for me' -- when in reality the desire has nothing to do with her and everything to do with me. the same attitude is what leads men to do awful things to women.

*she does not fulfill my desire. i do, through my actions.*

i won't spend three dollars on a soda but i will spend 60, as well as give up my personal information to almost certainly unsafe sites, just for a single picture. of her. all sense of protection, Action, and being goes out the window.

indeed, i had such vigorous thoughts about actions i would take on her body, without thinking for a second about what *she* wants. that's so gross!!!

yes, she *is* beautiful (in that conventional attractiveness sense) and yes, i am violently attracted to her. i want to feel her breasts, her skin; i want to look at the shape of her body. i want to grab her ass, trace her smooth skin. i want her hand to grab my dick and for her to be covered in my cum.

i need to remind myself, however, that 'achieving' her body will *not* solve any of my problems. i seek that pleasure because of a lack in my own life. the achievement will not fulfill any of the real lack.

indeed, it will only increase the wanting, the suffering, and the feeling of lack.

relationally -- does this not color the way i interact with her? do i not interact with her differently because of this attraction? because of the warmth and safety i feel from her? how i crave even the slightest look at her body, her cleavage -- how when she looks even a little less than perfect, there is a disappointment that surfaces within me?

i acknowledge the ways i feel about her. i further acknowledge that my attraction is in part because of this warmth and safety, and it is great that i have found this person that provides me that! 

but i cannot let this color my actions; i must relate with her as a human & as a being.

further: all these conceptions i have of her -- her whiteness, her crunchiness, her whatever -- who cares ??? why do i need to judge ?? i acknowledge that i think and feel these things, and i also acknowledge that i have no need to change the way she is acting. she is not hurting anybody, and she has many positives that i am simply ignoring.

so. how do i repent? what are concrete action steps?
- i accept the consequences of my actions last night. the charges on my card might just be there to stay.
- i vow to never make deepfakes again, of anyone
- i vow to not pursue, or act in a way that leaves open the option, physical intimacy with her
- i vow to forgive her for any harmful actions she may have done in the past; 
- and i vow to make a continued effort to treat her with compassion, forgiveness, and non-judgement
- i also vow to make a continued effort to protect myself from my own unideal affects regarding sammie, including:
	- feelings of resentment
	- being intimidated by her confidence
	- jealousy and envy
- i accept that she is someone i find immense comfort and openness with, and i acknowledge the goodness in that. i allow myself to be the one that 'puts in more effort'
- on the flip side: i vow to make a continued effort to not harbor resentment toward her for not connecting with me in the way i want. i vow to take space when i feel like there is not much connection at the moment, but to do so not harboring resentment, and being open to connection whenever it arises.
- i acknowledge that i am an imperfect being, with many conditionings, and i am on a continual becoming towards goodness
- and finally, in general, i vow to continue my path towards virtue, practicing restraint, especially with respect to my actions, feelings, and thoughts with respect to women, sex, and porn.
