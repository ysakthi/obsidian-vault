it hit me today that sometime in the past weeks, when thoughts, images, or reflections of the crisis arise, i have shifted from feelings of despair, grief, fear, and anger to ones of possibility, disattachment (in a good way), security, and abundance

though it is not the sole cause of this, [[(23-03-25) let's make this wasteland bloom]] actually gave me so much hope

and [[understanding capitalism]] has taught me so much about how what we're seeing today is an intentional effect of capitalism. this knowledge makes it easier to deal with, because there's clear enemies, clear goals...

i'm thinking of this because i saw today on IG that ohio is passing a bill to mandate teaching the "other side" of climate change. and i literally did not care. i have moved far enough to the left to be unfazed by this. no real change can be expected at the electoral level

further -- having hope does not negate that quote i really like from [[desert]] !! this hope is a hope-in-despair, a life-in-death, a creation-in-destruction, a becoming-forward that is localized and temporalized. a recognition and a resignation to the cosmic Yes.

[[take action]]   [[the crisis]]   [[hope]]
