#to-do move these to more distilled notes

apartments with bright energy and sunshine make me happy  
  
cooking slow food in a rustic house ðŸ’– (like turkuazkitchen)  
  
i am afraid to be and live at a slower pace than others, and to need more rest and lazy time and downtime  
- i see the opposite of that as superior (i.e. a more active person will leave me because im less active). can't the converse be just as true (someone who is always doing things is not slow enough for *me*)?  
- relate this to adhd : i don't need a diagnosis for someone to respect my limits and my energy. as long as im not hurting someone, then it is okay and good and necessary for me to be confident in asking for accomodations, even if they're stupid.  
  
i am paying rent and i cost a lot to replace at work. i do not need to beholden myself to my landlord or boss  
  
chopping vegetables to cook makes me happy  
  
lighting is so important  
  
why do i loveee chloe's apartment
 - bright
 - open
 - green
  
i want at least a trio it's such a comforting buffer from the duo while also keeping the possibility of being intimate  
  
i want to play sportssss
