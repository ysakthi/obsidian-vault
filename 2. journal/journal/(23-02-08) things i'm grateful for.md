my friendship with maité  
lane’s love  
sunayana’s heart  
sammie’s ease of connection  
nitya’s continual encouragement  
the spiritual guidance my friends give me  
the free time i have to do what is truly important  
amma and appa’s support  
yanu’s calling me  
people reaching out to me, continually, wanting my presence  
the entire set of circumstances that has allowed me the clarity that i have  
my body for being so healthy  
finding interests that keep me engaged (piano, chess, walking, meditation)  
finding the dhamma (dharma)
