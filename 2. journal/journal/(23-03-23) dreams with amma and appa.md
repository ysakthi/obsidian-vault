nearly every night for weeks now, i've been having intense emotional dreams involving appa, amma, or both.

with appa, they usually involve angry outbursts

with amma, they usually involve sad outbursts

the onset of (the frequency of) these dreams is definitely correlated with my and appa's "mentorship" sessions
