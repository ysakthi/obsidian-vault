i want to do more art -- and do things more artistically
a lot of this has to do with patience and my mindset. forcing art isn't really gonna happen -- but as i massage out my knots, becoming less caught in things, space will open up for Form to start naturally arising. this doesn't mean i don't ever push myself to do something artistic(ally). this is reflective of the constant struggle -- allow to arise on its own, while also finding opportunities to imbue with my effort and intention. and as always, this is a positive thing. do it when you do it, and be grateful when you have done it.
