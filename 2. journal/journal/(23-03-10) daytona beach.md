today when i was at the beach
what i didn't realize till i stepped out from the water,
where i had been playing with the waves,
was that i hadn't been thinking.
i had no worries, my mind and body
so enveloped in the blue water.

back on the sand, the first worry crept up
and it was foreign yet familiar --
no, it wasn't that it crept up
i just noticed again -- as if it
chose to stay, calling, knowing my attention was finally not on
making sure my head was higher than the waves

i wanted to run back into the water so bad
i knew it would soothe the thoughts
capture the attention
give me a release i didn't realize possible
salty as it was, stuck in my sinuses
and burning my eyes

i ran back into the water later, and
the waves were picking up then.
if you were at the right spots at the right times,
when the swells were big and just about to break,
you could ride them far, almost back to shore.
staying atuned was a whole-spirit activity.

no space for thoughts to stay
so they swelled and they broke,
rejoining the sea.
