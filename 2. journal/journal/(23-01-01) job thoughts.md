i want collaboration & cool ppl & energy  
  
edtech startup seems like a great time  
  
some older thoughts  
----------------------------------  
easy job collaborative don't need to put too much effort but one that i look forward too  
  
being around ppl helps achieve goals, reduce willpower needed (think Ted talk)  
  
maybe i need a monastery (hostel duo)
