the idea is to replace carbs with fats
remember that this is not to be restrictive, but positive & nourishing, and a guide

beans, lentils, legumes, chickpeas, etc.
- carb source
nuts, seeds, nut butter  
alternative flours
- sparingly
fish & seafood
poultry, goat (just cuz i need it lol), eggs
(moderate) dairy, yogurt, cheese
lots of veggies & in variety
- minimally cooked is really good !!
*real* whole grains -- quinoa, rolled oats, millet etc.
- carb source
berries & fruit
healthy oils & ghee
starches - sweet potatoes, tapioca, squash, kizhangu, peas
herbs & spices
health drinks
- kasayam
- red wine (in moderation ofc)
- cacao (unsweetened ofc)
traditional foods
- kanji
- satthu maavu
