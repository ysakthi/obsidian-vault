what is my pain? what do i want to be seen?
i haven't slept -> it has hurt me
i want care
i want someone to tell me i'll be ok
- without me asking for it
- this feels really good

i want the ppl close to me especially to See it -- proactively
i want ppl to bend for it
- i.e. sunayana mentioning sleep less
- this forms some kinda connection? obligation? tie?
	- keeps her from running away?

also it's something special -- is a big part of me at the moment
- actually: it's a big part of *how i see myself* at the moment
- and this should be Seen
- plus i would be sensitive for others, so why isn't she for me? <-- instinctive thought process
	- would i hold space as well? would i be as patient? diff ppl have diff qualities!
	- unfairness -- shakes up my own values -- what if my energies are misplaced?
		- they are *not* -- we are finite creatures who are constantly learning !

i am really starved for touch & affection

when i wake up after not sleeping and it feels gross, i just want comfort -- a hug and all the affection
- i feel like i deserve the care and comfort, in those moments
- a yell to the universe -- why don't i have it now ?!!?!

and i want it proactively because i don't want to ask
- asking feels like weakness ?
- but also, again, if they don't see it, then do they really care about me? [[abandonment|and what if they leave]]?

why might sun not be seeing -- or expressing the seeing? options:
- her way of expressing is different (she does care and she does think about it, and is ready to hold and accept whenever i express -- and there *are* times she is proactive about it. when she says "this is about me", it really is about her)
- i am afraid of saying the hurt bluntly (i know what i mean. i can't say the words just straight up -- i need to *make* something of them)
	- this isn't bad. just an observation
- i am afraid of saying my needs bluntly, too
	- i.e. i need support from you as i navigate this -- i need you to ask me how i'm doing, how my sleep is, etc.
	- i tell all these stories around it! give myself grace -- accept and cherish myself for being able to communicate my feelings so effectively !
		- 'not the woman's job to take care of me'
		- 'she won't receive it well if i word it bluntly & conventionally'

is it valid that i don't want her to mention it as much as she does?
- yes
- but also: remember that everyone has their own stories (lifeworlds) related to things. i should also ask myself: why does it affect me when she says this thing? what is my expectation of her?
- she cannot always tread around things because of my feelings
- but this sleep thing is serious -- and there is the residual effect from me not feeling fully seen when i was seriously depressed

takeaways/action steps
- abandonment
- bluntness
- everyone has their own lifeworlds
- expectation (of others)
- confidence in my identity
- my not wanting of mention isn't invalid -- but i have many other steps i can take first
	- express the feeling
	- express the residual depression feeling
	- express what i need from her
		- explain the role of *proactively expressed* care & relation to abandonment
	- ask if the content of my feeling is accurate
- after these, if it still happens, i think i am allowed to put that on her
