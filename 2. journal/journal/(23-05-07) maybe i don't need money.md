for the first time in a while, i had the thought that maybe [[money]] is not a necessary *upaya* for my liberation

two streams lead into this:
1. my own progress till now -- and detaching myself from a lot of things
2. aupe, its people, [[understanding capitalism]], learning about community power and all the examples around the world

going to the picnic last week (see 5/5 daily reflection!) really showed me that money is not most important !!

honestly, it feels like my heart just wants to stay in cleveland at the end of the six months

i just need to communicate these thoughts (openly, not as if i've made a decision) with [[sunayana]]. i shouldn't assume that money is so important to her or that she wouldn't understand my wants, happiness, and situation . . .

this, ofc, is not a final decision. still thinking about attachment...
