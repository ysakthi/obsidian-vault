ask for guidance and long-term mentorship, not just one-time job help or something  
- building relationship and trust  
- underlying: make sure my intentions are right (relationship, not transaction -- EVEN if they ultimately aren't able to help me out)  
  
come prepared ! with both your own questions and also responses to what they might ask you  
  
i need to be able to talk about myself and tell cohesive stories and tell my background
