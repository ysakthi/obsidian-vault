[[things i want to change]]

for a while i did not Do because i didn't get the point. now i realize that there is not non-Do -- you are always do. (does do=yes=is=be=create=positive=multitude?)

brush, sugar, no reels/reddit, pause everything else

awareness can be a curse -- on personal and interpersonal and extrapersonal levels
- worried about aki
- worried about ani
- worried about how chitti controls & interacts with aki and ani
- worried about yanu (this is more of a past thing)

me & akshat -- my soapbox
- i need to be more holding of space than trying to impose my views

who can i be for them

flow, fluid -- i waited to go on a walk till i was ready to -- then i did -- and it was great
- freeness

making an effort to not care what fam thinks of me

plurality and participation

lots of things abt kamma, memory, sankhara, language, etc.
- much metaphysics clicked

meta: i think i don't care about reflecting on my week in fl as much as using my being in fl to reflect on the past months/year/etc
