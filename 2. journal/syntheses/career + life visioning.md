>'Most big, deeply satisfying accomplishments in life take at least five years to achieve. This can include building a business, cultivating a loving relationship, writing a book, getting in the best shape of your life, raising a family, and more.  ^ca8e86

>Five years is a long time. It is much slower than most of us would like. If you accept the reality of slow progress, you have reason to take action today. If you resist the reality of slow progress, five years from now you'll simply be five years older and still looking for a shortcut.'
