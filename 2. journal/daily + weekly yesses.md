##### 5/2
- feeling so grateful for the trust that Erika & Lique are putting in me with DemCo -- they make me, my experience, and my knowledge feel as important as their own
	- example: erika asked if i've ever done an application review process, and if i have any tips. i said "yes, but only in college/high school contexts, so not at this scale" and they didn't even seem fazed
		- lesson for me: my experience and knowledge *is* important, and i don't need to pad it !!

- good vegetable kurma
- excited for the day tomorrow
- got a lot of unpacking done! one or two days left at most

##### 5/1
- had a really good one-on-one with sidney, and what stuck out to me most is how i was able to take control of the conversation (bc the onus was on me since i asked for it) !! and yet i took control *as* a listener, and stayed listening, but i showed for myself that i *can* take charge of interactions if needed !!
	- but i still like when other ppl take charge hehe
		- but not too much like lique
- realized for myself that when i am in line with my systems, i *feel* better

	- i was able to actively let my social anxieties arise, then stay, or cease if they wanted
	- also, i made the effort to make conversation, even if i was worried that i would be weird or received with judgement!
	- important: i let myself affirm that i do like it more when i'm in a group where everyone is people i love! beatrice and sabian are cool, but honestly i prefer groups where everyone is my friend and i feel all the love
- stayed at ant's place and got good sleep!

### 2/21/23
[[on sleep|slept really well]]

in general, i am in a place where i can start pushing myself more -- in all areas

spent lots of money on food but that's okay -- that's because i was out and with people. and the people, namely, was anna! and she's amazing and we laugh together (and what more could you want?). her brother is nate and her sister is joy and her friends bekah luana nikitha chirag rohit priya morgan . . .

did four whole focuses -- got back into my journal business

did laundry ! and folded !!

spending this last part of the day thinking about positives (using the word in the sense synonymous with 'optimism') -- there are many -- and i can celebrate myself

to improve: being a listener, being present and relaxed in interaction

i didn't get to the gym and i haven't exercised since saturday -- but that's okay -- it's okay to not go -- and it's okay to push myself -- it's (and prolly even Good) to do my usual -- stretch pull up dip squat deadlift mountains plank leave -- ok to go at daytime and then not sweat rest of day -- love my protein smoothies with blueberries and flax

i am getting refocused after the sunayana hiatus -- i love her -- i truly want the best for her -- she wants the best for me -- she thinks of me

i love this system
