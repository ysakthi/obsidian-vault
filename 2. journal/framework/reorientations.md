- one sandwich at a time
- almost everything i dread ends up being fine (or better than fine) if i actually just go/do
- my state, emotions, wants, intentions, and attitudes will change
- good sound quality makes music so appealing
- cultivate mind, body, action, thoughts, etc. and meditation will come
- there is infinite input yet finite energy
	- finite energy does not mean limit engagements; it means limit sustainment
- to remember better, don't sustain; forget. to have more friends, don't spend more time with people; be alone. to keep track of everything, don't organize; create. to figure something out, don't analyze; let it fester.
- BE worried, knotted, uncertain
- return to [[(23-03-25) understanding more about systems|systems]] -- rest on them -- fall to them -- the way you do to breath
- don't be deceived -- a system is a system because you *don't* continually re/construct it in your head
- my energy fluctuates naturally throughout the day  
- a couple minutes of lay, rest, eyes close, or do nothing can be just as effective as a smol nap  
- a good night's sleep plus a 20 min nap is enough to push through the whole day (and you do want to push, and develop the practice of pushing, so that you die at night)  
- service to the immediate is valid and enormous
- can i not only accept myself at my most unpleasant, but cherish? and trust in myself?
