- eat when hungry
- cooking
- quality of food > quantity (i.e. eat as much as wanted!)
- no joke: eat sugar as wanted. before doing so:
	1. see if hungry & need food
	2. see if nap or wind down time is needed
	3. analyze (see [[to not do something]])
	4. ask [[questions]]
	6. delay gratification
		1. see [[healthy dopamine]]
		2. can it be postponed to tomorrow?
		3. stack some tasks in front of it
	7. go for sugar!
		1. is there a healthier / less indulgent alternative? perhaps that i can make?
		2. but ultimately: if you are craving something, do it.
- triggers
	- just ate meal
	- just woke up in morning
	- have things to do
	- sleepy
