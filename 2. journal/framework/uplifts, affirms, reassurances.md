- i can Be with my thoughts, even at my worsts
- it is okay to simply avoid or weather  
- absorptness into head is not un-okay. just might be easier to meet goals without  
- if everything runs away . . . i am still here  
- i am soft and steady and strong  
- my presence is a gift
	- related: right now, i take long times to reach out to people -- and that's okay, even if they are quick
- i have learned that i CAN make plans to talk with people, and it goes well, and i usually need to prepare very little if at all!
- it's not only that i will, but that i am  
- i am capable of Being just as much sleepy as rested  
- i will not compromise my being for others  
- i will be my own person
- i will not chase feeling good
- even in the most knotted states, i can find pockets of freeness & solidity
