moving to new york with very little money
- and comparisons to sunayana

having to deal with amma+appa again when discussing yanu's schedule & her staying in cleveland


moving: ugh and oh-no and aaaah
- affirmation: a few hours of focus one of these days WILL get *most* of it done
- affirmation: the other times, i can put it out of my head
- affirmation: i can ask ant and anna to help again (and they themselves have offered)

always-state of up and of need-To
- aff: freeness + breathing + systems
