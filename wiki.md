## best practices & using this PKM
for now, this is my info/ideas/synthesis/reflection/creation space

in general, i need to ***use*** my systems (incl keep). it's best if i make a practice of visiting all the categories on a consistent basis. this & keep are not just passive storage mechanisms; they're active, living, breathing, and giving. i.e., this is a reciprocal space.

maybe the most important thing to remember is that i do not need to keep everything. in fact, it's better if i do not keep everything. ***in other words, treat this as a positive space.*** everything that goes here is good, but not everything that is good goes here. the main rhyme and reason to what gets put in here is contingency and temporality.

that last statement is incomplete, however. there is one other rhyme and reason for what gets put in here, and it is that inner heart of the massive, interconnected world i am building. if anything, this is the main point of this system.

remember that ideas are dynamic, mutable, and fallible.

i should make *synthesis* and *recall* regular practices

finally: *knowledge* *exists* *in relationship with the world*. it exists in stories, in dialogue, in being, in thinking, in relating, and in doing. this PKM is a useful tool in the larger whole, but it is not wise to become attached or overly reliant on it.

## my full PKM
- ***doing*** is the most important thing
- again, remember: the interconnectedness of this system is only as useful as its use. use, use, use - - consistently. and make sure you're doing real work here, not just organizational stuff. 
- my systems are now at a state of good enough. stop developing them.
	- the only things i really need to add are top-level categories for *new content* -- e.g., journals business.
- obsidian is the ***unifying*** and ***synthesizing*** place everything goes into -- ***it is not the final or ultimate place***
	- so ***put everything into obsidian*** -- ***but don't use the fact that something is in obsidian as a basis for throwing that thing away or deleting it***
- my overall good-enough system:
	- tools:
		- pen and paper for most things
			- storage: folders, notebooks, sketchbooks, etc.
			- one notebook is plenty
		- google keep, calendar, tasks for practical & daily things
		- obsidian for longer-term things or more general non-practical things
	- practices:
		- developing a quiet mind, and developing a consistent (soft) mental practice of recollection, reflection, remembering, synthesis
			- ***this is the most important thing***
		- fleeting notes go anywhere
			- in here, best to create a daily note or create a new note in either journal/not-atemporal or the mu folder
		- literature notes go here in the literature folder
		- everything from all different sources, physical or digital, gets put into here
			- this doesn't mean that they then get deleted or thrown away
		- synthesizing (usually) happens on paper or in obsidian
			- if on paper, take pictures and throw in here, for keeps
			- it makes a lot of sense to synthesize info that's in obsidian on paper !! and then throw it back in here !
		- creation doesn't necessarily happen in obsidian, but it's not a bad place
		- importantly, the tool itself (the signifier/invisible mode of action) must also become its own practice. but NOT in a meta or reorganizational sense -- i.e. take the structure i have established as pretty much immutable. best practice would be to regularly go through my folders, read my old stuff, delete things, etc.
	- attitudes
		- unafraidness of the piling of mountains
		- focus on doing and action
		- focus on mindset and attitude
		- fear of losing is a bigger blocker than losing :(
		- primary focus, as always: the mu
			- and *faith* that that will make this better

## synthetic practices
a synthetic practice is not only creative. it is reinforcing. even if i never look at the synthetic creation again, the very act of synthesizing reinforces and develops ideas and information.

my synthetic practices:
- keeping a running 'on my mind' doc to collect, jot, and write
- doing periodic synthetic writes
	- the difference between this and the previous is that this requires looking through other notes, pen-and-paper things, literature (if applicable), the graph, my thoughts, and other sources
- doing a recall write after engaging with literature
- making distillation notes
	- once a certain concept seems to be developing, it deserves a distilled page, replete with links, tags, info, ideas, and whatever else.
	- a distilled note probably will be a tag page
- deleting OLD notes that have been synthesized and distilled
	- if the note is recent or still applicable, don't delete it -- even after synthesis !!!
	- be careful about deleting tag pages

## organizational practices
- regular pruning, grooming, and organizing of the system
- regular deletion and forgetting
	- tho don't worry too much about this

## tags and links
- some tags might be in two different nests -- like [[6. obsidian stuff/tags/gen/the arts/art|art]] and [[6. obsidian stuff/tags/personal/art|art]]-- where the second is about my own art practices/reminders, and the first is general art
	- but, as a rule, try to avoid this. the nesting is more for ease of accessing tags than it is for functional tagging
- some tags have tag pages -- especially sources (ppl, books, etc.)
