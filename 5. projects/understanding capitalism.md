[[decolonize]]   [[capitalism]]   [[take action]]

### general notes
the fed needed to manufacture unemployment because it was too low meaning workers could have more confidence in asking for rights

### Week 1 - Historical Materialism

### Week 2 - Commodity & Value Theory of Labor
capitalism is a game of selling what you have. if you have material (mainly land, since all material comes from it), you sell it. but for most people, all you have is your labor -- so you sell that. the **wage** is just the purchasing of your labor -- for an undervalued cost, because the wage-giver must make a profit.

### Week 3 - Competition & Crisis of Overproduction

### Week 4 - The State & Imperialism
american capitalism was built off of the conquest of land (material) & labor. the state co-emerged with capital to protect capital's interest through the employment of legal violence.

monopolies, through state violence, obtain land, material, and labor from foreign lands -- and they *need* to do this

the global south is the global working class -- imperialism "\[imposes\] on the South a one-way flow of capital, goods, and services, and the airtight closing of borders as a first containment barrier against emigration to the North" (regalado, latam at the crossroads p20). in the meantime, the global working north with its state-monopoly infused institutions, creates transnational practices and institutions to preserve the global *concentration* and *development* of capital

##### **AlJazeera, *how US involvement in central america led to a border crisis***
banana wars - US occupation of nicaragua
sandino's revolution then the subsequent US-backed coup

cuban revolution -- US's 'backyard' -- scared the US
80s -- the US went ham in central america

guatemala
- '60-'96: civil war, government backed by US & CIA, 200k dead, 83% of which were indigenous
nicaragua & el salvador, honduras, guatemala
- reagan 'central america's problems' bro!! 'don't want a second cuba in our backyard'
- reagan and carter tried to 'stamp out communism'
- 85% of the violence attributed to the US-backed forces
a million fled to US in the 80s -- the US didn't grant asylum or refugee status. people needed a way to support their & their communities' mental health. so they formed gangs. when they were imprisoned and deported, they flourished back in their home countries.

2009 coup in honduras -- obama cabinet said it's not a coup so that they didn't have to cut aid

US money has only gone down, while security funding in the area has increased

imperialism *is* monopoly capitalism

##### **regalado, *latin america at the crossroads* pp 18-21**
pre-monopoly capitalism --> monopoly capitalism a.k.a. imperialism
three stages ^9b23f0
- just monopoly capitalism
	- this was a time when the state was in the interest of the whole bourgeois class
- state monopoly capitalism
	- the state is only in the interests of the elites
- transnational monopoly capitalism (<-- we are here)
this is a orthodox marxist viewpoint. the neo-marxist viewpoint is that imperialism is always a part of capitalism.

### Week 5 - Reproductive Labor
reproductive labor is just as much work as paid work

### Week 6 - [[race|Racial]] Capitalism
in general, the theme here between the two readings:
there is no abolition of \<blank\> without the abolition of capitalism
- racism
- prisons
- gender
- etc

##### **robin d.g. kelly, *understanding racial capitalism***
race is more than identity
anyone can be racialized irrespective of phenotype

***there is no ahistorical capitalism*** i.e. ***there is no purely general/conceptual/Ideal capitalism***
- the question of whether there can be a non-racial capitalism IS A NON-QUESTION
- kelly doesn't like the usage of the term 'racial capitalism' that much bc ppl take it to imply that there can be a non-racial capitalism
- capitalism and racism are 'co-constituted'

europe was already racialized (irish, jews, roma, etc.) and this was the civilization capitalism developed in

the war on the 'social wage'
a lot of what we see today is from the 70s actually !!
in general, in this course, i am learning more and more about:
- neoliberalism
- keynesian economics

caste != class

'racism is about controlling the behavior of white ppl, not black. for black ppl, guns and tanks are enough'

police technically are agents of the state -- but really are agents of property (capital), bc the state is in service of capital

##### ***prisons and racial capitalism***
'if there is always a population of unemployed people, all workers become replaceable.'
- worker organization becomes less confident

modern racial logics (logos) justify a large surplus (unemployed) labor pool, predominantly black/brown
- the not-working proletariat -- *lumpenproletariat*
- similar to unpaid feminized labor
- ocean frames it in her presentation (tho i don't think they're their words) that the logic of race veils the logic of surplus labor

### Week 7 - [[disability]] & labor
##### **marta russell**, *marxism and disability*
ultimate goal of extracting as much surplus value for as little cost
just need to keep a baseline reproduction of the labor force going

all institutions in capitalist society are built around employment & labor
all spaces in capitalist society are built around employment & labor
that's why sidewalks, buildings, etc. are not built with disabled people in mind

there is constant [[fear|FEAR]] in the capitalist class of losing control of the means of production
so they need to make the people afraid
of becoming racialized, of becoming disabled, ultimately of becoming unemployed
makes so much sense that healthcare is tied to work
they don't WANT non-employed ppl to have healthcare

and they DO want a consistent pool of unemployed ppl, both to draw on when they need labor, and to use as fear factor

##### **sunny taylor**, *the right not to work: power and disability* (2004)
ADAPT (american deisabled for attendant personal-care today) at forefront of disability justice
the MiCASSA act, which then became the Community Choice, STILL has not been passed :(((
disabled ppl marched 144 miles in their wheelchairs and there was no press

"...what is our point? perhaps...that disability is a political issue not a personal one. disability theorists make this clear by making a subtle but significant distinction between ***disability*** and ***impairment***" (emphasis mine)

what did [[disability visibility]] say on [[embodiment]]?
- my definition of embodiment: being a body (and the how of this being)

some cool stuff on [[ontology&metaphysics]] and [[being]] on p6

it is not the physical dependence that sucks, but the stigma around it ([[interdependence]])

right not to work is a materialist ontological question

ending nursing homes is an important step that disability justice advocates for

so many connections to [[vita]] and scapegoating in this piece: we see in disabled ppl the truth of our own being, and it's not sexy. the common reaction is to shun.

### Week 8 - indigenous land enclosure
[[indigenous]]   [[land]]   [[latin america]]   [[mexico]]   [[zapatistas]]
#### EZLN, *critical thought in the face of the capitalist hydra*
##### *a view from the perspective of the zapatista communities*
exercises in *imagination* -- connects to the stuff about colonization of the imaginary/imagination from [[(23-03-25) peter @rhizome]] -- like the meditation we did
- when we have our mother back, what must we do? how must we work for her?
##### *toward the genealogy of the hydra*
wallerstein built an [[the modern world-system 1|orbital telescope]]
- pg6 "what the indigenous communities are providing us...is the hard evidence of displacement"
- i.e. indigenous people are the "mirrors" of the telescope
capitalist system is in a crisis
- crisis of overproduction?
a main idea is that the hydra is expanding and (legally) dispossesing more and more
##### a talk by roberty hernandez and kristian emiliano vasquez
[[identity]] "*visualizes the relations of power*" (p10)
- o my goodness so many fonts of [[semiotics|signs]] i'm putting together
	- \[dispossession of\] indigenous ppl being evidence -- mirrors -- of hydra expansion
	- all the stuff from my [[thesis]]
	- identity as an articulation that visualizes relationships of power
indigenous is a *[[flux|process]]* -- kimmerer talks about this in braiding sweetgrass
- but this does NOT mean that [[place]] is irrelevant
	- land back is still important !
- and ignorantly and violently re-indigenizing is very much possible
the [[mu|diversity of life]] -- race, indigeneity, disability -- all these identities are imposed and simply reflections of power relations !!
#to-do look up land taxes like the Ohlone's
##### "the council of pecans" from *[[braiding sweetgrass]]*
even tho identities of indigeneity are not fully tied to place, they are fully entrenched with the land -- it's just that the identity moves from any one specific places into the relationship between person and place -- something that they can carry when they move (voluntarily or not) -- and so the land is fundamental to identity of indigenous -- which is why dispossession of identity (de-indianization) through boarding schools is of the same character as kicking them off the land! that's what kimmerer and the hernandez/vasquez talk above are trying to say!
- interconnectedness of land, language, body, identity...

### Week 9 - Capitalism and [[ecology|Ecological]] Collapse
a subconscious dissonance of mine had always been: this knowledge about capitalism, land, reciprocity, earth systems, planetary justice, etc., is so amazing and so new -- and i am grateful to have encountered amazing sources that have taught me about these things -- and i see a unified, coherent, consistent framework stretching from ancient indigenous cultures to modern eco-anarchism; but will other people see it this way too? what if they don't encounter the "right" sources like i did and end up with different frameworks?

but now, i am coming to realize that this IS a highly unified, coherent, and consistent framework, and that many people coming at it from many angles -- anarchism, indigenous knowledge, the dhamma, anti-capitalism, etc. -- invariably end up saying the same things! my dissonance was my projection of *my encounter with the knowledge* with the knowledge itself.

#to-do i really want to learn more about latin american anti-capitalism! evo morales, hugo chavez . . .

thinking about discourse around the word "socialism" -- i feel like ppl buy socialist ideas until you put the word to it

i think what is so important about [[kimmerer]]'s and other indigenous ppl's writings is that they bring in the spiritual/relational component

### week 10 - the political category of "animal"
### week 12 - dismantling capitalism
dual power -- prefigure postcapitalist institutions while working with current capitalist/quasi-capitalist institutions
- and eventually, the former fully replace the latter, because they cannot coexist

cannot stop thinking about: necessity of spiritual change
 - do not believe that material/structural/behavioral/etc. change does not effect spiritual change -- but might we need to make spiritual change a primary as well ?
 - thinking about [[trod]] and carrying a heart of truth / compassion / selflessness
	 - boddhisatva wisdom will serve important, likely
 - radical being involves:
	 - selflessness
	 - pain
	 - sickness & lack of healthcare
	 - immense activity, confusion, fog, world-changing ideas, life-questioning experiences...
	 - breathing
	 - death
	 - unrealized vision
	 - giving up of ideals
	 - service
	 - convenience
	 - non attachment to one's participation & creations
	 - etc etc
### week 15 - zapatistas & cuba
remembering that a book is an arboreal form of knowledge, while life is not -- and neither are thoughts. so when i have these thoughts relating and comparing these movements, communities, structures, and lives to dhammic ideals, i must remember that living in those movements is *life*, and very few people are thinking about the entire movement in an arboreal way like the book or my thoughts.

complexity:
"However, Chiapas remains one of the poorest states in Mexico. Ninety-four of its 111 municipalities have a large percentage of the population living in poverty. In areas such as Ocosingo, Altamirano and Las Margaritas, the towns where the Zapatistas first came into prominence in 1994, 48% of the adults were illiterate. Chiapas is still considered isolated and distant from the rest of Mexico, both culturally and geographically. It has significantly underdeveloped infrastructure compared to the rest of the country, and its significant indigenous population with isolationist tendencies keep the state distinct culturally.Cultural stratification, neglect and lack of investment by the Mexican federal government has exacerbated this problem,"
- these are facts
- but
- do they cover cooperatives, collective access to healthcare, domestic violence, etc. ??

i asked in class about inner work & outer work, and ppl said things along the lines of "i blossom if everyone blossoms" -- but i think i really need an answer to the buddhist question of "work out your own salvation with diligence"
- i think mahayana & the bodhicitta worlds might have more answers i'm looking for
- and indigenous spiritualities maybe?

and idkkk, ocean said along the lines of "changing the way you do social transformations changes your body" butttt like don't you shape your world in the image of your karma? (intention + action)
### course reflections
- guided synthesis, active reinforcement, and reflection activities
	- doesn't need to be mandatory, but would just help with reinforcing
- i have been given [[(23-03-27) i am moving from despair to hope|hope]]
