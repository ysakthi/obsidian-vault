### spectra of intention
my framework of language was anthro-essentialist, basically saying that human language was special
but sitting on the grass, i see that i am distinct, but not different, from the life around me.
we all be
we intend, we act, we instinct, we react
we sit and we look
language falls on this spectrum

### metaphysics
from [[deleuze, a stoic]]: "'depth' refers to the interpenetration of all bodies" (p34)
- i think i kinda got this wrong; i saw the surface as being on top of the depths. but really, the surface is topographing every square inch of the depths; it is not simply resting on top. 
- in other words, there is nothing in the depths that does not have a surface. my model, however, does.
- in other words, the surface does not belong to the same geography as the depths (though it belongs to the same world); "there is no depth when referring to incorporeals themselves. depth is corporeal, and surface is incorporeal." (p35) the incorporeals are immanent
- this is important because i use the same-geography surface-depths framework throughout my paper
