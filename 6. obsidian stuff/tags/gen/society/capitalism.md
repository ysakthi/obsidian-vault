capitalism is *centralization* and *development* ([[understanding capitalism#^9b23f0|regalado]]) of capital from *land* and *labor*

capitalism is a web of relations, right? and that which determines the nexus of relations is that which determines the politic of a society -- so *capitalism is its own politics* -- and any explicitly stated political structure is incidental (and probably a lie). it can turn at the flip of a switch from "democracy" to explicit facism. this means, then, that *there is no reason for why the state might be separated from capitalism* -- and why states with socialism or communism are seen as such a threat to the US -- because they threaten the US state
