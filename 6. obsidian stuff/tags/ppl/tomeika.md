### 3-31-23
talking about my [[systems thinking|systems]] and how i'm building them and it's great
- her word of advice: keep doors open so that you can move to different systems easily
she suggests making my own maslow's hierarchy, starting with my base systems at the bottom #to-do 
with amma and appa: we're in a period of transition -- both them and i !!
- and transition is healthy!
- they are transitioning to a different kind of parent -- and it's less of a parent and i'm less of a child now !
gotta take care of all dimensions! bio psycho social spiritual

### 2-24-23 - working out & meditation habits
eventually, movement will become *the* focus -- and ill be able to make it happen  
  
just do the small ones !!!  
  
remember consistency over intensity !! 
  
a 5 minute meditation is ok -- and it doesn't even need to be the fallback. it can be the primary !!!  
  
and it is OH KAY that i forgot about this. it's very okay. reinforcement and practice  
  
energies fluctuate. if i didn't have the energy for things, i didn't have the energy for things. this can be the justification -- it doesn't need to be that "im focused on other things so im not putting energy into this" -- i don't have to know *what* is taking up my energy

### 10-21-2022
talking about what i want to do (esp starting a business)
  
I DONT KNOW WHERE IT'LL GO !!  
^^ so important to remember  
everything, plus more, will be figured out!
  
i will figure out how to do different teas!  
or coffees!  
or how to do bulk!  
or how to make it live!  
etc etc  
i don't need to have it all figured out now :)
  
  
sure, not everyone has this privilege that i do  
but it's a blessing -- it would be bad not to use it!  
plus, a lot of people do have the privilege!  
lil foolish to think i have everything -- there was and is a lot of lack in my life. it's not all about money.  

  
unrelated: taking photos can be a way to be mindful  
plus, through photos i can revisit this space when im drowning in winter
