listening to braiding sweetgrass (which i think is the best way to engage with the story)
- from chapter "the grammar of animacy"

making me rethink a lot about participation, emptiness, baseline, etc. -- and i had just done a lot of thinking. i might have to revamp 

what if the baseline from which participation springs is not emptiness, but a plurality?
- the cosmic Yes
- the Language (of animacy)
- listening (from the heart -- which is what the Language *is*)
- gifts
- stories
- relations
- the tao (but in a non-essential way, that is, not saying that all this *is* tao, but this is another world of listening, affirmation, animacy, relation...)
- mu/sunyata -- but in the sense of awareness, and how it's not a negative or a deconstruction -- or a thought or a word -- or an intention
- mushrooms, trees, squirrels, people
	- literally! not using these as particulars of a general or as metaphor. literally, mushrooms. trees. squirrels. water. and so on.

this is all *positive* !! 

all non-humans speak the language. we *can* -- we are born with it -- but then it's stuffed deep inside us
- and remember -- it has a grammar! it's not some loosey goosey thing

when i ask 'but why' -- shouldn't the better question be, 'why all this'? why are we always moving *toward*?

AND - most importantly - the key step - the action which gives animacy to these ideas - is practice - listening - action
