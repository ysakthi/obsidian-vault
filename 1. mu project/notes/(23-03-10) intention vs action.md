longstanding question: how does intention turn into action ?

answer: it doesn't

intention *subsists* in the action and is *inseparable* from acts of body, mind, or speech -- this is something i have learned from observation

see [[(23-03-09) why it's easier when i do less]] and [[(23-03-06) a revelation about sankhara]] 

[[6. obsidian stuff/tags/gen/dhamma/kamma|kamma]]   [[intention]]   [[mind]]   [[stoicism]]
