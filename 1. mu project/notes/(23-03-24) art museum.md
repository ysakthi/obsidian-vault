went to CMA with [[anna]] today

really liked [[lenckhardt, descent from the cross]]
- there is so much love, both in the piece, and also in the creation of the piece
- 7 years on one tusk! and it really, really shows!

talked with Jacques at the art museum today
- should always consider socioeconomic context of the artist, but also once the artist puts it out there, it is to be consumed by each individual in their own temporal and personal contexts
- around 1850s is when art started to become more available for everyone, not just nobility and rich ppl
	- which is great
	- i asked about how we think about the fact that a lot of the art in the museum was made (comissioned, usually) for high class ppl, but museum visitors are not that
- the politics of art & artist are important, but for jacques, the "search for beauty" is above all else
	- for example, picasso's [[picasso, guernica|guernica]] makes a strong political statement, but it may not be absorbed by everyone -- that's okay -- it is also beautiful -- and that is primary
	- a lot of contemporary art, acc. jacques, makes strong political statements, but isn't beautiful

we also talked about spain, france, basque country with jacques
