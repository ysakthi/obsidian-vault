take refuge in the fact that while this is new to us, it is not for a lot of people  
they have found ways to survive (or live while knowing they will die) for eons  
in a time if destruction, create  
create individually  
create in community  
create with others  
create for others  
create community  
create, create, keep creating  
when the apocalypse reaches its tipping point, we'll be the ones on the margins  
we'll be the ones imagining new ways of life  
on the florida isles  
or the indian desert  
our life spans may become no more than 30 years  
but the fear i am experiencing  
is because i am so used to comfort  
i am not used to destruction  
many people are, though  
learn from them  
connect fearlessly  
create fearlessly  
create connection fearlessly  
drop attachments  
you might have to let go of ppl not aligned  
understand your fear is a product  
the state has conditioned in you  
to make you think you have nothing without them  
but that's not true  
you have incredible creative potential  
you might not be ok  
you might not survive  
but this fear, it is not new in this world  
people less fortunate than i live with it on a daily basis  
learn from them
