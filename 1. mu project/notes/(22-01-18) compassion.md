Be more ok with letting people change things up for you

The importance of _company_ in relationships (think: my kitchen talks with amma, and ammai, taking time out intentionally from my own life to just provide company and help // or chinna thatha sitting cross legged on the countertop talking with chinna atha as she cooked)
 
hospitality -- having people over or pay people a visit

asking for help also important, not just giving 

"Let's take a walk and talk about it!"
