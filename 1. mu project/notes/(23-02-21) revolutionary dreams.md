 on this zoloft bender of the last few months (<-- ok maybe an exaggeration. my dosage is not super high @75mg), coupled with the insomnia :: hyperrealistic dreams. vivid imagery and intense bodily feelings that i remember, cognitively *and* physically, after i wake up.   

i have had two dreams over the past few months that i want to write down here. one is the demonstration in China where we were taken into a room (i was an onlooker who got caught up), the CCP military general told all the infiltrators to come forward, and they ratted out everyone in the group who was a demonstrator. one by one, the demonstrators were shot. phan was one of them. i remember the sadness as he was getting shot. (how fucked up is this??) i remember cowering, my face to the floor, avoiding their sight, hoping my name wouldn't be called out since, after all, i was just an onlooker. luckily, it wasn't. the twist: at the end, everyone left alive was asked to become an infiltrator.

the catch-22! the hopelessness of it! either die or become the enemy. a few things stick out to me about this dream: the coherence; the applicability, namely that i could totally see a real revolution facing these immensely despair-inducing struggles, and these feelings too; the realness of the feeling.

the other dream is where i was living in an apartment building with a group of friends, who included sakthi uncle. we received the news that the entire third and fourth floor was being evicted, and they threatened us with physical violence if we didn't leave by 11. all because of a landlord's groping scandal. uncle wasn't having it. he was talking real loudly about how unjust it was, and i remember trying to calm him down, saying they would come for him if they heard him, to think of his kids, to think of the kind of role model he wants to be for karthi and shri. eventually, they did come for him -- i guess they heard him -- they put a bag over his head and dragged him off. this led us all to swarm the ppl taking them away. here, i remember not wanting to make the first move. an invisible fence separated us from the abductors by just a few feet, and i guess we were waiting to see who would be the first to do something physical. because there were more of us than them (about 50:3), but we were afraid.

then -- i don't know how it happened, but i found myself actively participating in a huge clamor. we were dragging the abductors around, freeing sakthi uncle, chasing them out of the building. at the end, we knew they'd be back with reinforcements. but this dream, unlike the previous, ended with a feeling of success.

interesting. i think the ending sentiments of these two dreams reflect a shift in my attitudes. in the first dream, which was a month or two ago, i was feeling more despair around the possibility of revolution. now, i am seeing more and more that noticing the counter-becomings, taking positive action, and appreciating every success, is not only the way to go; it is the only way to go. (see: [[desert]])

dreams are real, and insightful. it's as if i'm experiencing the revolution firsthand, but in a virtual machine. unlike virtual machines, though, there are real emotional effects outside the sandbox. it's like dreams are a practice or testing land.
