ken wilber -- theory of everything -- what unsettles me?

from dan koe's [blog post](https://thedankoe.com/the-focus-formula-how-to-take-control-of-your-life/)):
> Holons are best understood through philosophical contemplation. Pick something random, like an object in front of you, and follow it down a rabbit hole of discovery through questioning.
> 
> Seriously, pick an object and ask a series of what, how, why, where, and when questions.
> 
> Do not limit yourself to the physical world here, or even direct connections.
> 
> If I were to choose “honey” as my holon to dissect, my mind can follow it to:
> 
> -   The process of making honey
> -   The bees associated with pollination
> -   The beekeepers and if they are making a living wage
> -   Whether any harm is being done to the bees
> -   The manufacturing and distribution process of honey
> -   How the honey impacts human health when consumed
> -   And onward to infinity

the problem: to truly know a rock, a la [[dogen]], is to NOT engage in constructions with it
dan, ken, are obsessed with theory over being !
ken seems to be on to something about Spirit, but the true [[(23-02-22) my brain exploding|language of animacy]] is through *listening* (says [[kimmerer]])
but then, my q: how do you Be without the theory?
- maybe you need *some* theory -- but you do NOT need wilber's books
- philosophizing *feels* good
- Being -- (listening) -- takes effort -- and the effort does not feel good


---
i am also obsessed with theory
i acknowledge this
i also acknowledge that the theory, to me, is not much more than:
- fulfilling my desires -- as a healthier alternative to less wholesome fulfillments
- a way to make money (i.e. participation)

ok update: that's not *entirely* true. i do have vested interest in my philosophizing -- i do believe it to be right. and i do believe it can change the world
