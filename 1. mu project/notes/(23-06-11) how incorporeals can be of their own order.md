In this framework, incorporeals are not separate or transcendent entities but rather immanent aspects of the world. They are not caused by bodies in the traditional causal sense but are instead co-existent and co-emergent with bodies. The relationship between corporeals and incorporeals is dynamic and reciprocal.

While corporeals, referring to physical bodies or entities, have their own order and movement, incorporeals are virtual or potential aspects that interact with corporeals. Incorporeals can be seen as the virtual or potential dimensions of bodies, the virtualities that bodies express or actualize.

Deleuze's philosophy emphasizes the immanence of these incorporeals and their ability to generate new possibilities, transformations, and becomings. They operate in an order of their own in the sense that they bring about novelty, variation, and difference within the realm of bodies. Incorporeals introduce a level of indeterminacy, creativity, and potential that goes beyond the determinism of bodies.

In this way, the order and movement of incorporeals are not constrained by the specific order and movement of bodies but rather engage in a complex interplay. Incorporeals can influence bodies by presenting new potentialities and trajectories, shaping their actions, behaviors, and transformations. At the same time, bodies provide the materiality and context through which incorporeals can actualize and manifest.

The relationship between corporeals and incorporeals is thus characterized by a reciprocal causality, where bodies affect and are affected by the virtual dimensions that accompany them. This reciprocal causality allows for the emergence of novelty and the dynamic unfolding of existence.
