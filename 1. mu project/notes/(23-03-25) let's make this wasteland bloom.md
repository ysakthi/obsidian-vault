### what [[peter gelderloos]] said
the [[imagination]] (the imaginary) can also be colonized  
/is/ colonized  
  
capitalism post WW2 has taken over and re-constructed much of our imaginary  
  
imaginaries containing blueprints & [[abstraction]]s of land are colonial  
so you don't imagine an 'ideal' sim city -- you engage in dialogue, starting with what is already here

### a thought i had
assignment and co-imagination -- is that still individualistic ? putting the action on doing ?  
  
what if we co-created instead ?  
  
idk

### memory is re-creation!!
remember that answers already exist  
  
remember that [[memory]] is (re-)creation!!  
  
there is no single model of stewardship
