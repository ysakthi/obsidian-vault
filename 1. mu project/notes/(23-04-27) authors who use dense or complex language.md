[[hegel]] uses complex language in part deliberately, to reflect his metaphysical stances !!
i'm sure [[deleuze]] does that, too
there is a prevalent attitude in college/school among peers of "this author's writing is so dense, so it's bad" -- that may just be related to our need for easily digestible, non-thought-provoking language
