[[multitude]]   #me  [[time]]   [[abundance]]   [[practices]]   [[ontology&metaphysics]]   [[positive]]
*plurality* is becoming more and more apparent. i think it is deeply connected with *temporality*. plurality is non-essence talk. plurality is abundance-think. plurality is temporal thinking. plurality is positivity.

i am moving from a negative (deconstructive) phase to a positive phase. here, purpose and pleasure disjoin. this leads to boredom, because my old positives have been deconstructed. and since we -- and the cosmos -- are a resounding Yes, we need positives. i am currently constructing those positives, in the form of activities, plurality, focus, mindfulness, interacting with others, and so on.

in [[dhamma]] terms: the cultivating of virtue (positive) is as important as the detachment (negative)
