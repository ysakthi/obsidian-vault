update 3/6/23 - see complications to this with the concept of queer ecology -- see [[disability visibility]] - 

maybe there is validity to concepts of male and female, of mother and father

and maybe there is a biological link, too  

and this could be completely separated from gender
 
in other words, sexed language has some use (the caring mother, rematriation, male and female trees, etc.)

it's just that sex is entirely different from gender (which is social performance)

in this framework, motherhood is a valid concept -- it would just have nothing to do with your gender. anyone could be a mother or father. in nonhuman animals, and especially plants, performativity becomes less of a factor (though it's not entirely gone). so there is more of a correlation between physiology and sexed language.
