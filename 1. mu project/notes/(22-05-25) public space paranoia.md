i sit at night at mangomango  
creatures occupy and adapt to spaces   
how can we make public spaces safer  
esp for women   
   
if it was commonly understood that those occupying an outdoor public space would not act unsavorily  
  
less surveillance, less paranoia  
  
if it was understood that someone occupying space near your business or home was not threatening it or you
