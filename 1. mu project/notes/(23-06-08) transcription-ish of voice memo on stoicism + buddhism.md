bodies are the material of & only things with
the way bodies are organized by effects, dhammas are organized by (intention)
this is quasi-causality of incorporeals & intention (karma)
transports us from pure dhamma-flow into All This
this shows the analogous & corresponding connection between buddhism and stoicism

dhammas are not atomistic, but contain multitudes
dhamma is both primary and post- (like redness, for example) -- paradox
paradoxically, both the extraction and the thing which is the material of the extractive action

what are the implications?
evolution & genesis
language
intention theory of everything relates these

stoic metaphysics is not only something to be conceived of and believed, but felt in the body, and lived
the stoics understood this

with this ineradicable picture painted, i can argue that attempts at metaphysics are often futile
bringing in the two truths: it's fair to say all this (project) is convention
and, since ultimate truth is not different or distanced from convention,
all philosophy is conventional, and the goal of that philosophy is conventional
the goal is never to reach the ultimate
we use the ultimate as a truth, remembering that everything we do is conventional
powered by intentionality, our actions & intentioned responses

stoicism/berg/deleuze can help elucidate buddhism:
qualitative multiplicity, multitudeness of singularities

when caught in accumulating / frantic theorizing, i release
what this frame offers is conv ground to explain our conv world better
that ofc ultimately undoes itself
this undoing necessarily accompanies any good explanation of convention
but now we dont have to stand on loose or holed flooring
guves us a new paradigm for explaining our world that is both true and yet just a fancy
maybe can help us get away from trying to theorize our way into the ultimate truth, spirit, unity, nirvana, whatever
the stoics have a sense of nirvana: fate
and they have Practice (ethical, mental) to achieve ground of being

(we also get grounding for western science)

this is our convention
there are many conventions. a world of many worlds
imposing this framework on anyone else is delusional
bc the ultimate ground of being is beyond explanation, translation
and the act of spreading, convincing, or imposing is itself what takes you out of the truth
true ground is silence, observation, animacy, action, pure Being, process, \[ \]
but also none of these
this ground is only useful for the western lens, bc that's our convention

sections:
relativity (moral or perceptual). here we discuss realness, climate, ecology, etc.
idealism-realism
logic & pure math
evolution
language
animacy, which is a stand-in for this circulating thing that some have grasped
the self, as a practice

truth is not something we need to work toward
truth was already there -- not in texts, but in practice

titles: dispeller, abhidhamma, prolegomena

back to the fundamental picture: what is karma? seed, intention
the fruiting of karma is not to be confused with karma

there is a mental element to dhamma
bodies have it, too: all psychological processes are bodies

are dhammas external phenomena received by senses, or are they the conjoining of object with faculties
manos can sense all dhammas, while the five can sense their respective slices
they are small slices, for the mind can sense (conceive of so much more) than the five senses
but that's an iffy take. but what i do know is that the mind can conceive more
all parts of the sensory process, including vinnana moments, can be dhammas
dhammas are not mutually exclusive. they are different slices or extractions

note to myself: i should become deeply familiar with the stoic/berg/del pic and the abhidhamma pic
i need to be precise & accurate with all this

rupa is the conjoining of sense object with sense faculty
in this way, a kantian-ish picture arises
but we go beyond: and say all this is dhammas
and even *this* is a fabrication (a word used without its negative connotation, like a carpenter)

back to larger scope: there actually is a deconstructive motive behind this project
deconstruct the crud, the tumors, the mudpiles that western convention has built
towering piles, towering knots, like we see in new york and chicago
like we see spreading -- or maybe developing -- across the world
these skyscrapers of intention leading us to violence, evil

we do however understand the value of western convention
evolution, e.g.; a beautful theory
quantum mechanics, physics
the symphony orchestra

quasi-causality can help us understand paradoxical nature of kamma
bc on one hand, we have everything as just *happening* -- going, tumbling, crushing, rolling
on the other hand, there is intention, which creates all this
quasi causality gives us language to understand this, the way qual mult gives us language to understand dhammas

there are various ontologies within this western system: black, for example
divergent visions of self-being, of being in the world
informed by lived experience, oppression, or lived identity
queer ontology, mexican ontology
my project does not touch or deconstruct those because they occupy slightly different conventions
my project is for those who this project would apply for (which ik is circular, but makes sense)
it is for the convention that it tries to break down & there'll be ppl who understand themselves as part
maybe i'm thinking of canonical, arboreal conceptions & cosmologies
distanced from feeling, being, relating, engaging
that a lot of other ontologies like black or queer do seem to capture
as we get closer to centrality -- whiteness, ableness -- we get more arborescent
more distanced from feeling & the spirit.
that is whom this is for

another point of this is to
move us from theorizing and conceptualizing and into more fluid, messy parts of life & philosophy
that constantly generate and de-
that we weave in and out of life, being, the lived
i say this thinking of what jbk might say:
go take a walk
you're essentializing
