1. ultimate
2. aggregates + sense-bases + karma
3. dependent origination & other machinations of (2)
4. corporeal + incorporeal cosmos
	- this is where we can talk about interconnectedness, boundlessness, etc.
5. conventional convention
	1. machinic + linguistic lens
	2. science, the world, morality, etc.

notes
- only useful in the philosophical space -- not useful anywhere else -- so don't try to fit everything, or even anything, into this. unless it's specifically western philosophy.
- none of these are naggy's convention, which is all of this
	- hm actually... maybe it is (5) ?
- where does the machinic/linguistic lens fall?
- are (2) and (3) the same ?
- look into abhidhamma+ deleuze for better clarification
