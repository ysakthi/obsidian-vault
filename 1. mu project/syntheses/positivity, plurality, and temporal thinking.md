i saw while cleaning through my gkeep that one of the things i wanted to learn was 'temporal thinking'. i think this was from listening to a phil podcast on deleuze (philosophize this! i think) and the dude mentioning how deleuze tells us to think 'temporally'. well, i've done it :) and i feel so good about it.

it is funny how temporal thinking is related to positive thinking (in both senses of the word)

it is so very cool to have a community of co-learners doing this thing together. autonomous political education is so important. and it has been a cornerstone of every revolution.

as jeremy said, despair is what they want you to feel. however, don't be despaired about despair! allow yourself to feel.

we must participate -- and this is a continual struggle i am having. i think it makes sense that participation is a necessity, though -- and the necessity of participation in capitalism can be justified in a few ways:
- broadly, it is a particular instance of the broader concept of participation that i use -- i.e., participating in conventional reality
- 'capitalism' is not a thing. it is a useful tool (and we participate in the linguistic, conceptual, and practical (omg 'practical' is related to 'practice') usage of 'capitalism'), but we must remember that there are capitalist and non-capitalist becomings
- from a justice standpoint, avoiding participation is like saying 'i don't see race'
- from a social/political standpoint, capitalism *is* our current totalizing economic + political structure (remember that capitalism is its own politics) -- it provides us with our modes of relation, our material substances of subsistence, our culture and values, our socialization, and more. ultimately, as living beings, we need to subsist on the substances we have. it's just easier -- and prolly necessary. futher, adopting a universal anti-capitalist approach is an attachment/knot.

aspects of participating:
- financial literacy and [[financial independence]]
- outward appearance
	- fashion
	- grooming
	- body
	- confidence, posture
	- social skills
- accepting navigating or learning to navigate the marketplace, social situations, financial situations, and most other institutions
- accepting technology & information (this obsidian system is part of that)
- accepting non-ideal situations, conditions, etc... like medicine, psychiatry, living in urban environments, etc... we don't want to be escapists or like the crunchy types

checks on myself:
- the knots !
- [[what is important to me]]
- how i feel & what is taking up my time
- spiritual state

participation is positivity -- even in the realm of ideas and practices (e.g. participating in working-for-results). why? because when you have sufficiently deconstructed, then awareness -- or mu -- becomes the only non-positive (it's not even a negative). outside of words, outside of concepts, outside of practices (remember that practices is not just about the word or the thought 'practices'). so then you are (metaphysically, i guess) allowed to take anything and everything as a positive. even that which may be contrary to the ultimate grounds; for example, working for results. and this is because contrariness is also a positive. everything is a positive. (remember remember that these are about more than the words or conceptions of these things!!)

i think positivity is the coolest concept. both senses of the word flow well together.
