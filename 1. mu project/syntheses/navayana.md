### base metaphysics
start with the five aggregates, six sense bases (and 18 elements)
kamma
- intention
conditioning
dependent origination
convention
ultimate truth
nibbana

### language

### our conventional existence
- three marks
- conventional truth
- upaya

### ultimate truth & nibbana

### rebirth

### kamma, our actions, our intentions

### space, time, causality
- temporality

### being & positivity

# personal practice
### knowledge vs. practice

### 'orthodox' practices
- mindfulness, eightfold path, protection, all that jazz

### dhammic practice as guidance/foundation/principle
- open up to all forms and worlds of wisdom
- this is not a reductionist approach -- dhamma is not at the 'core'
	- explain *why*, don't just say it

### upayic practice
- everyone's practice is unique
	- is this sadhamma?
- finding your own frameworks, etc.
	- nothing is created purely by you
	- acknowledge sources; acknowledge co-creation and relation; nothing is done alone

### relational practice
- giving up one's own needs and wants
- acceptance, protection, all the good stuff

# a world where all worlds -- the 'truth'
- fanon's Yes
- language of animacy
- the Tao
- God
- but treating all these in non-essentialist ways

# our world
### the truth is inseparable from its contingent conditions

### diversity & interdependence

### dhamma as interweaving the social and the personal

### what is politics?

### adhamma of the colonial world

### class, race, capitalism, queerness, disability, all that good stuff

### ecology

### decolonize

### plurality

# science
### physics compatibility

### health, healing and medicine

# philosophy
### morality

### metaphysics

### nihilism, solipsism...

# religion

# mind, psychology, etc.
