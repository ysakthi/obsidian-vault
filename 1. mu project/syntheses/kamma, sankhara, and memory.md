### kamma
*cetanaham bikkhave kammam vadami*

kamma -- that is, intention -- is the seed
it is always fruiting
the fruiting of kamma is twofold and on two axis: immediate and distant, space and time
- there are effects of kamma *here*
- there are effects of kamma *instantaneously*
- there are effects of kamma *out there*
	- note: this one is just upaya. helps with compassion to think of an out-there
- there are effects of kamma *later*

the kamma-seed, the planting of cetana, cannot be separated from action, which is manifest in one of three forms: kayena, vacaya, manasa
so *intention cannot be separated from action* (tho it is a relation of subsistence, not identity)

you may ask: is everything the body or mind does action?
no. everything is fruiting (including sankhara) -- some fruiting just causes more planting.

i'm actually *not* going to use 'sankhara' here, even though i originally did, because it has many uses in dhamma texts and i have yet to seriously learn it. but if i did use the concept right now, i'd probably say that sankhara is purely a set of *mental* activity, one of which is cetana. all bodily, mental, and spoken action is just *stuff* that is perceived and passed through the aggregates' stages. sankhara does *not* include most mental activity (thoughts, feelings, etc.).

as a personal note: of course doing less leads to more mindfulness. bc kamma does not distinguish between body, mind, and speech. so less generative. ya feel? #me

### memory
when sunayana said she usually remembers things when she's been present \[during that thing\], it was something i really wanted to accept. but i couldn't, because in my mind -- wasn't presence about _not_ holding? and isn't memory about holding (and also recall, repetition, etc.)?

revelation:

_memory_ isn't a category of being. where does memory fall? how does it work?

*recall* is usually what i've referred to when i've referred to memory. recall is just fruiting -- which means that which is recalled strongly is that which is planted strongly.

recognizing that kamma does not distinguish between an internal and an external, we see that memory is stored everywhere. and when the right stimuli come (whether of thought or of other senses), then the conditioned sankhara arise.

putting these together: presence _does_ foster remembering. even presence in the external. and it fosters it more than being distracted.
