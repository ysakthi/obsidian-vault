## indestructability of stoic metaphysics
leading up to a metaphysics that connects the stoics, bergson, and deleuze
indeed, some elements of this are deleuzean -- but we just gonna call it stoic metaphysics

inescapable

argument: indestructable because any attempt to refute it necessarily reifies it

what are the kinds of counterarguments?
- logical breakdown (internal)
- equally valid alternative
- incomplete picture of things
- incorrect picture of things
- mismatch with lived experience

what "are" bodies? the better question is why bodies; or, what role does the idea play?
bodies are not posited to describe anything. they are posited to act as a representation/image/abstraction of the animate force around which we always circulate in our descriptions, and with which we follow along in our intuitions. "body" is misleading because there is nothing corporeal happening. corporeality is the representation of is-ness. plurality, or the fact that one can say bod*ies*, is representation of an after-the-fact divisibility, or a non-unity. in other words, it allows for the differentiated animacy that is this force (otherwise there would be nothing). animacy requires difference and difference requires animacy.

the position of ultimate reality \[dharmadatu/sunyata/tathata\]: no framework can fully explain what is, 

can't say that this is The theory -- only that it works -- and if it kills a rat, it's rat poison
- killing the rat here is destroying convention

## brief outline of first bit
- maybe the strongest link between western and buddhist phil
- there is a question that arises: how do we get from what Is to All This
	- the felt transforms
- stoic answer
	- bodies + incorporeals
		- logic of sense and johnson book
	- sense, feeling
- buddhist answer
	- dharmas + karma
		- a collection of sources and what they say
		- my picture
	- differing views on ontological status, but doesn't matter
	- i want to trace these concepts through indian philosophy
- we have a correspondence
	- isomorphic and analogous
- the stoic and buddhist frameworks are foundations for the rest of their metaphysics
	- with this connection made, new frontiers open
	- add rebirth as a section
- there ofc is the connection between the two ethical / praxical systems that has been much talked about. their metaphysics are (a) deeply intertwined with and (b) subservient to praxis
	- so we have new frontiers opened here as well

## some elaboration on events
the event is the expressed, even if there is no expression. what does the event express? does it express all the events around it? does it express its corporeal causes?
- when i say "this is a carpet": at once, there is denotation (of the carpet), manifestation (*i* am saying), and signification (concepts of this, is, carpet)
	- the underlying *movements* are the events: my saying; the carpet's is-ing; this-ing; etc.
	- carpetness is hovering over the bodies
- if i point at carpet and say "this carpet is not a carpet"
	- sense doesn't care about the words. there is still (a) intention and (b) expression here. so the event is very much alive
	- for example, the event of my affirmation (which is a realizative/performative affirm)
	- events, organized into the table, give rise to my expression (which is corporeal
		- so even before i speak (or think), the surfaces organizes the states of affairs. this is quasi causality and this is pre-individual
			- i think this organization
		- and yet only a certain set of events could be present "here"
		- but what is "here" when bodies interpenetrate everywhere? there are patches of surface everywhere...the expression is the unification and stabilizing...maybe it is that one of the patches calls out, becomes actualized -- and it is atomic, meaning that when one surface organization has arranged the totality of bodies, nothing else can mess with it
		- also, it is timeless -- it is not as if another organization comes *after* or *before* -- we always just find ourselves in various organizations, various states
		- it is every time there is an expressed -- but where the expressed is any kamma-generational activity (sankhara???)
		- so the organizations do not arise and cease; they are outside of time. they are our fabrications. what do arise and cease are bodies, or dhammas...whenever we have a fancy, or a feeling, or whatever...there is an organization
- *i* do not actualize sense when i speak
- soooo, to answer the question: the event *is* the expression, and expressions are All This (that is, All This is expression)
	- *feelings* are just really strong carriers of intention-expression

## is one unit more basic than the other?
what are the monads? bodies or incorps? dhamma or kamma?
what does it feeeeel like
i must look

## interconnectedness of incorporeals
"each incorporeal can be understood as a specific expression or instantiation of the virtual" -- chatGPT

remember that we get to the individual from the totality, not the other way around (e.g. like with atoms) because it is not a discrete multiplicity/manifold

## combined picture
dhammas + kamma <--> bodies + incorporeals

dhammas/bodies are the "material"
what is the connection between material and fate?
so far i have been asking: how do we get from What Is to All This
- can't our actions change the material? a bronze's existence does not necessitate its becoming a sculpture

so...there is this *stuff* -- this non-quantifiable, non-discrete flow of experience
- why do you need anything else? why do you need action/intention or incorporeals?
- maybe because of our happiness?
- but this leads to determinism
- it's not the leading-to-determinism that's the problem; it's the prioritizing of the corporeal over the incorporeal, when it seems to be that both traditions prioritize the incorporeal, and see the corporeal as (just) the material
	1. so here's where i'm at: if we just said everything was corporeal, that would be fine, except for the fact that there is organization, separation, distinction, and sense
	2. remember that kamma is not just action, but organization of dhammas into our lived experience
	3. sure, we can say that the organization and sense is a fiction, an illusion. but the fact is that we can still *say* and *understand* and *distinguish*. even if these things are illusory, we still are living in and affected by this illusion
	4. there is also a sense of self-destruction: when you say this is illusory, you are still *saying* -- in other words, this entire conventional world is built on your intentions, of which saying is a manifestation, even if you say a negative or a deconstructive
	5. thus, the *only* way to escape this illusion is to de-intention yourself, which is the stoic/buddhist path -- anything else would be *constructive* (which i think deleuze was onto! tho maybe he did not see a way out and so thought there was *only* creation)
- but then: does convention line up with incorps and ultimate with corps?
	- no, because even this picture is conventional.
	- maybe this is what the abhidhammists missed: they were trying to describe ultimate, when the fact of the matter is you *can't* (even as upaya)
		- the distinction isn't conventional-ultimate, but is-convention and BLEH
			- naggy was onto this

## theory of everything
* animacy

## deconstructing our convention
* the goal of this
* upaya

## evolution & genesis
effectivity > representation

## karma & transmigration

## language

## science

## flux, interconnectedness, fluidity, play, freedom
* provisional provisional teachings
* these are byproducts, not central -- but still important in this convention

## dispeller of disputes
### panpsychism
### the realism-idealism debate
### relativeness
### causation or causality
* talk about uniformity principle here
* ok ok ok so causes don't do anything to other causes -- there's no pushing around
	* this is an effect (lol) of splitting the causal chain. if causes pushed on other causes, then they would be effects lol
### logic & mathematics
### the self
### duality & distinction
### space
### time
### mind & body
* the psychological "status" of dhammas + bodies
### materialist/scientific determinism
- are we just amoebas?
	- sure, but even still...there is organization
	- and this vibes with the fact that buddha + the stoics are not *explaining* anything; they are simply describing
		- and a description cannot be argued with

## what do i want to do in a project?
- trace stoic metaphysics *in the stoics*
- trace dhamma, kamma, etc. through indian philosophy
