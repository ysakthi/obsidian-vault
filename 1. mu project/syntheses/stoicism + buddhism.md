[[deleuze, a stoic]]

this isn't a question of free will
i don't think it's a question of feeling either

everything, including intention, can be seen as bodies
including conceptions & handling of incorporeals

intention conditions the world, but intention is part of the flux
sense/incorporeals condition the world, but sense/intention is part of the movement of corporeals
it's as if either side can be completely subsumed by the other
- we can think of everything in terms of corporeals (stoic)/flux (dhamma)
- or, we can think of everything in terms of incorporeals (stoic)/kamma (dhamma)

another parallel: kamma is of its own order, as incorporeals are of their own

in [[(23-03-10) intention vs action|this]] i asked how intention turns into action. i answered: it doesn't. to elaborate:
- intention cannot be picked out from the crushing stream. you move to a whole separate order to be able to pick out intention
- in other words: intention is inseparable from actions (of body, mind, speech)
- but it isn't right to say that it is just another part of the stream. why? why do we pick out intention in the first place?
	- because we *do act* - we *do* live in this world of meaning and everything -- i.e. convention
	- we could just say it's all part of the flux, but that's not useful
- but then, i might say: this isn't about utility, this is about being right
	- then i would say: "being right", and the knowing itself about flux, is a participation in convention
	- nothing can be claimed -- e.g., being "right" -- without conventional participation
	- so the incorporeal layer/surface/stream IS necessary, not just useful

an important note: convention is not just language. convention is being (or doing?) itself
- this might be another paradox: while bodies/flux is the only thing that is, the only way to be is through incorporeals

i have corresponded the incorporeal stream with the kammic stream
now, to work out the correspondence.

can think of everything as acts of intention
language is a subset
acts of intention can either come from conditioned sources or from volition
- imma call this quasi-volition, because technically it is determined in the flux, but the flux itself is quasi-caused, so we are not wholly bound

what about the incorporeals of space and time?
note:
1. space is not spatial space; space is extensive condition for being
2. time is not temporal time; time is movement condition for being

i do not know if the above is what the stoics intended, but i think it makes the most sense
i need to learn for myself what the relation between the three incorporeals is

in my own frame, however, i thinkkkkk space+time can be wrapped up into "sense" -- or maybe, all three can be wrapped up into the single intention surface

why does this framework work? it addresses its own circularity

another question: the corporeal/incorporeal and flux/kamma dualities co-match, but do they match with the convention/ultimate duality?
- i think not
