spectra of intention, bla bla bla

the main split to reconcile: spectra of intention vs. the uniqueness of human third-party discourse/indirect discourse 

*does* this need to be reconciled? maybe i am comparing a cognitive concept to a metaphysical one. maybe the third-party indirect discourse cognitive capacity is just a special bundling of intentions.

addendum: tis also possible that there is a slight spectrum of the third-party indirect discourse, too -- i.e. it's not just a yes for humans & no for non-humans.
- does not have to be the same qualitative (type) or quantitative (shape) spectrum as the intention one (which is THE spectrum)
- maybe it is extra prominent for humans and dips steeply for non-humans, and is faint there
