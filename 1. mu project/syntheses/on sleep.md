[[tomeika]] says there's nothing wrong with my sleep in and of itself. and to celebrate my good sleep when it comes :)

fulfillment -- energy -- movement -- sunlight -- mornings
sadhguru says you must die at the end of each day
it seems so;
you sleep so that you live (*live*) during the day; you live (*live*) during the day *so that you die at night* 
- *live* = push, create, move (body), awake, go, walk, do

nocturnal hypoglycemia
- fat/protein options:
	- nuts 
	- nut butter
	- full fat greek yogurt
	- eggs
	- avocados
- fiber options
	- fruit/veggies
	- avocados
	- rolled oats
	- dark chocolate (70+ %)
- no simple carbs 6 hours before bed
- exercise as early as possible

concrete daily things that nurture my sleep
- forcing myself to stay in bed all night, even if sleep does not come
- *living* during the day
	- mornings
		- lots of water
		- sunlight
		- movement is ideal (even a walk)
	- hydration all day
	- staying fed all day
	- having done things that i've been meaning to do
	- having done my dailies
- nighttime routine!
- consistent sleep + wake times (so important)
- no food 3 hrs before bed
- no water 2 hrs before bed
- melatonin not to feel sleepy, but to keep circadian rhythms consistent
- white noise (to keep other noises from waking me up, esp. during rem sleep)
- affirmations: if i don't sleep, that's ok !!

**some info on sleep cycles, acc. mcfadden**
early sleep is called phase 3 (lil lighter). then deep sleep. then restorative sleep, a.k.a. rem sleep.
each stage has all the cycles; this is just about which are most frequent. rem cycles are when you are most easily awoken.
