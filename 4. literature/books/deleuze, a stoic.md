### general thoughts
- it kinda does make sense to think of intensive as a difference of kind and extensive as a difference of amount
- however, i think i should put a hold on thinking of quantitative vs. qualitative multiplicities. because bodies are a multiplicity, but they are not *discrete* -- but they are not undifferentiated -- well, they ARE undifferentiated, but they are not a unity -- but incorporeals are not undifferentiated either -- but they are more not-undifferentiated ??
	- and if incorporeals are "flattened," how do they preserve the variation of kind?
		- i think it has something to do with the fact that they are singularities, i.e. the particulars are their own universals, whereas bodies are particulars of universals

### specific to section/page
p30 - what is the relationship between form and principle for the stoics? "'the principles are bodies and without form, but the elements are \[bodies\] endowed with form'"
- for plato, form is immaterial and a cause
- for stoics: is form material? yes, i think -- just like wisdom, vice, virtue, etc. form, however, is not its own ontological category -- just that elements have it, and principles do not

40 - i'm starting to understand that this corporeal/incorporeal duality is emerging out of necessity: to talk about stuff, we need incorporeals; to talk about incorporeals, we need bodies. in other words, the picture did not come first. boeri, "reciprocal dependence"

53 - #dont-understand  - the severed relation between cause and effect

62-64 connections to dhamma

p84 - #to-do - connect stoics' attack on atomism with mahayana attacks on vaisesika atomism

90 - place is space of bodies with bodies; void is space of bodies without bodies (i.e. the quasi-causal condition for body)

i understand static vs. dynamic genesis! static genesis goes from incorp to corp, and relates to integration, which holds in place a moving multiplicity. dynamic genesis goes from corp to incorp, and relates to differentiation, which is ever-changing flux
- remember that the incorporeal surface has its own order and is not purely at the mercy of the corporeals
- a lot of this comes through during [[meditation]] -- i leap back and forth between [[acceptance]] of intention & recognizing its non-ness to inhabiting its world -- there is no smooth transition

p116 - maybe primary/secondary/tertiary orders help understand spectra of linguistic complexity, allowing for the sense framework to expand to non-humans (which i am looking for)

the LEAP makes so much sense -- the givenness of the surface does not gradually lead us to the *feeling/experience* of intention/kamma/being/language; we must make an (alogical) LEAP from organization to being

p125 -- i #dont-understand how disjunctive synthesis "makes divergent series 'resonate and ramify' through their divergence"
