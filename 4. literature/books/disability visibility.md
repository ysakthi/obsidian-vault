ok so i had these ideas in [[(23-02-20) male & female]] that maybe there is (some sort of) space for biology in gender -- i had never heard of "queer ecology" before, but yeah, it makes sense -- and complicates (in a good way, not totally disputing) those thoughts of mine
* 'we find healing and justice in the realm of queer ecology, a burgeoning field exploring the vast diversity of gender and sexuality that exists in nature, such as the more than fifty species of coral reef fish that undergo one or more sex transitions in their lifetime, completely transforming their behaviors, bodies, and even reproductive organs.' -- patty berne, p233
