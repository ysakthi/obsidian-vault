### 24th series of Communication
the relation of bodies is destiny; the relation of incorporeals is \[an alogical\] compatibility or *expression*

169 : the wise person (brahmin) is free to (a) sink to nibbana, or the level of pure physical causes, and (b) to be on the exterior level of *expression*
- expression is pre-individual -- it is not just a human output, but also the input for knowledge, understanding, sense, feeling . . .

causes can only interact with causes; effects only with effects
- why is it not that the effects are being dragged around by the causes
- ildefonse: a body acts *for* another body as the cause *of* an incorporeal effect

the predicate is a concept -- the concept presupposes the event, not vice versa

the conjunctive synthesis *coordinates* divergent series, and the divergent synthesis *affirms* or *ramifies* due to difference, aka distance

events:
- compossible
- communicate
- compatible

"nothing other than the Event subsists, the event alone...which communicates with itself through its own distance and resonates across all of its disjuncts"
