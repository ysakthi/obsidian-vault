even indigenous ppl are immigrants. we need to practice our own habits of indigeneity and Nativity instead of skirting those because this land is not hours. we can only do justice to the indigenous people by learning deeply what it means to exist in relationship with the land that we inhabit no matter how ugly and urban it is. this does not mean that we keep the land necessarily but that we understand what it means to relate to migrate to move and to exist in an indigenous manner because we are immigrants but all people are immigrants. all living things are immigrants. all life is change and we need to truly understand indigeneity as a practice how to be at home in our homes in our ecology to understand what indigenous Justice really is and it's not just a matter of understanding this isn't just a theoretical understanding. this is an understanding that is practical, pragmatic, and enacts justice *as* the understanding happens.  #me  [[practices]]   [[place]]   [[flux]]   [[relationality]]

some stuff on the pecan chapter in [[understanding capitalism]]

the grammar of animacy ties deeply with my [[thesis]] in a few ways (see [[(23-02-22) my brain exploding|this]])
- another connection not mentioned in that note: language creates and reproduces different kinds of relationshps! like how english is mostly nouns and potawatomi is mostly verbs. think of semiotic marginalization from my thesis!
