colonization of name -- in turn, using the name helps

section one:
 - maize holds, remembers, teaches
 - maize relies (on us)
 - reciprocity -- this is not lost today, but is in a weird mutated form
 - we rid the human-maize relationship of subjectivity
 - colonizing the name discounts this relationship, which is hi-tek	


diversity vs uniformity is a theme

modern practices dishonor the agreement and make corn "subservient"

"genetic integrity" -- raping of the mother

corn itself is not just technological object but subject -- it DOES

"Western science and its worldview allow us to answer the question “Can we do it?” but are ill-equipped to address the question of “Should we?”"

"corn is a hungry crop and a thirsty one" -- which is why care is important

"I don’t blame my farmer neighbor for industrial agriculture. He’s been harnessed to a system that treats him like a cog, too. "
 - our treatment of corn violates our subjectivity too !

"it's the pain of betrayal"

"But we do need to restore honor to the way that food is grown"
